# Students attendance using opencv and esp32-cam 
![](Images/attendence.jpeg)


## Project Intro
deeplearning model responsible for detecting faces to take student's attendance

### Requirements
* Esp32-cam / laptop cam
* face_recognition libraryðŸ“š
* Arduino in case of using esp32 or any equivalent camera
* python

## Get started
**1- clone the repo*

`git clone https://github.com/Omar88magdy/Attendace-using-Face-Recognition/tree/main`
## image preprocessing


it's essential to preprocess the image uploaded before passing it to the model <br>
and getting back the prediction<br>
and all these preprocesssing procedure should be matched to whatever your model expecting to get to start getting predictions

## Needs of this project

- data processing/cleaning
- app developer
- Deep learning model



## Getting Started

1. pull the docker image **docker pull <image_name>:<tag>** from [Here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/omar88/docker_app/tags) Ensure Docker is installed on your system <br>You can download and install Docker from the official Docker [website](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
2. List Docker Images **docker images** (Optional): You can list the Docker images on your system to verify that the image has been successfully pulled
3. Run Docker Container **docker run <options> <image_name>:<tag>**
